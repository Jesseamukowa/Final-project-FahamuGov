# Final-project-FahamuGov
# 📱 FahamuGov

**FahamuGov** is a civic education platform built to empower Kenyan youth with accessible, engaging, and simplified knowledge of how government works — from budgeting and resource allocation to public participation and policy-making.


## 🚀 Project Vision

Millions of young people in Kenya remain disconnected from governance processes due to inaccessible, overly complex, or outdated civic education methods. FahamuGov bridges this gap by providing interactive civic lessons, gamified quizzes, real-time alerts, and participation tools — all in a mobile-first format.
